    <h1>Len "The Dog Whisperer" Tau</h1>
    <p>The marathon included the first two black Africans to compete in the Olympics: two Tswana tribesmen named Len Tau and Jan Mashiani. Len Tau finished ninth and Mashiani came in twelfth.</p>
    <p>This was a disappointment, as many observers were sure Len Tau could have done better if he had not been chased nearly a mile off course by stray aggressive dogs.</p>

    <h1>A Looney Toons Episode of a Marathon</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>This was the third appearance of the event, which is one of 12 athletics events to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Arthur L. Newton of the United States was the only runner from 1900 to return. Other significant American runners included the winners of the past three Boston Marathons: 1902 winner Sammy Mellor, 1903 winner John Lordon, and 1904 winner Michael Spring. Top foreign runners did not come to St. Louis.</p>
    <p>Cuba and South Africa each made their first appearance in the event. The United States was the only nation to have runners in each of the first three Olympic marathons.</p>
    <h2>Format</h2>
    <p>The marathon distance had not yet been standardized; in St. Louis, the course was 24.85 miles (39.99 kilometers). St. Louis organizers started the marathon in the afternoon, while most contemporary marathons start in the early morning to take advantage of cooler times of day. The race began and ended in the stadium, but the rest of the course was on dusty country roads with race officials riding in vehicles ahead of and behind the runners, creating dust clouds.</p>
    <p>The start included five laps around the stadium track, then runners were able to leave the stadium to take to the road course.</p>
    <h2>The Dehydration Experiment</h2>
    <p>The only source of water for the competitors was a well at about the 11-mile mark. James E. Sullivan was a chief organizer of the Olympics, and decided to allow only one water station on the 24.85 mile course of the marathon even though it was conducted in 32 °C (90 °F) heat over unpaved roads choked with dust.</p>
    <p>His ostensible reason was to conduct research on "purposeful dehydration," even though dehydration is potentially fatal. The marathon ended with the worst ratio of entrants to finishers (14 of 32) and by far the slowest winning time, 3:28:45, almost 30 minutes slower than the second slowest winning time.</p>

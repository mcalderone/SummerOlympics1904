    <h1>Andarin "The Wild Card" Carvajal</h1>
    <p>Postman Andar√≠n Carvajal joined the marathon, arriving at the last minute. After losing all of his money in New Orleans, Louisiana, he hitchhiked to St. Louis and had to run the event in street clothes. He wore his postman pants that he cut around the legs to make them look like shorts.</p>
    <p><strong>Not having eaten in 40 hours</strong>, he stopped off in an orchard en route to have a snack on some apples, which turned out to be rotten. The rotten apples caused him to have strong stomach cramps and to have to lie down and take a nap.</p>
    <p>Despite falling ill from the apples and taking a nap, he finished in fourth place.</p>
